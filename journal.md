My bolt light sensor chose to opererate when my light shined in a specific spot of the sphearo ball, Well... not just one spot but certain spots on the ball. it succesfully measured light, but i thought it was malfunctioning cause it wasn't reacting some times but i soon found out that it was due to the amount of light around it like the lamps and other peoples flash lights and because i had set it to the right light setting just to have to change it because that setting wasn't right ethier.

Today we are working on how computer science can influence other careers that are related to computer science, My first example is Police officers cameras, like in the video police wear cameras so they can enhance the saftey of officers and civilians. my second Example is Facial recongnition technology, Facial recongnition tech uses Clearview AI for police and or to identify Suspects, victims.

How i could balance be on social media while keeping my privacy is not awnser Unusual questions or text back people who try and offer me strange scams .

What concerens me about this type of technology is that Some people can't tell whats real and whats not. A way it think this tech couod be used is in is cyber security. I think that a robot should see the world through our eyes and value life as much as we do .
