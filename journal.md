My bolt light sensor chose to opererate when my light shined in a specific spot of the sphearo ball, Well... not just one spot but certain spots on the ball. it succesfully measured light, but i thought it was malfunctioning cause it wasn't reacting some times but i soon found out that it was due to the amount of light around it like the lamps and other peoples flash lights and because i had set it to the right light setting just to have to change it because that setting wasn't right ethier.
