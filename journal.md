My bolt light sensor chose to opererate when my light shined in a specific spot of the sphearo ball, Well... not just one spot but certain spots on the ball. it succesfully measured light, but i thought it was malfunctioning cause it wasn't reacting some times but i soon found out that it was due to the amount of light around it like the lamps and other peoples flash lights and because i had set it to the right light setting just to have to change it because that setting wasn't right ethier.

Computer science impacts my life in weird ways, like everytime i see  robot i always wonder what type of coding they used to command it or how they program games like subway surfers.

Today we are working on how computer science can influence other careers that are related to computer science, My first example is Police officers cameras, like in the video police wear cameras so they can enhance the saftey of officers and civilians. my second Example is Facial recongnition technology, Facial recongnition tech uses Clearview AI for police and or to identify Suspects, victims.

Some ways AI can help us is by running facial scans someimes people mistake other people for others like twins but most twins have one slight detail to tell one from another , and some ways AI cant hurt is that AI doesn't have feelings so when your grieving an AI therapy robot cant sympythize with you .

It is important for you to protect your private data because you could easily get hacked and the hackers could stela your money and other finances, they could also commit cyber crimes in your name. Some actions i could take to make sure that my socials are secure is by avoiding suspicious websites and cookies are on those very websites. Yes i have shared something very personal but i have taken the right actions and removed the content. How i could balance be on social media while keeping my privacy is not awnser Unusual questions or text back people who try and offer me strange scams .

What concerens me about this type of technology is that Some people can't tell whats real and whats not. A way it think this tech couod be used is in is cyber security. I think that a robot should see the world through our eyes and value life as much as we do .

the brain rot term to me means Content that fries your brain. Although social media is one of mans greatest inventions it has more bad then good impacts on alot of things other than my mind. recently The words lore connects to dad lore from the memes and i don't know where slop comes from.
In today's generration i don't think it's possible to multit-task.

I think that AI will affect the animation industry negatively, I think this affects people with a wide variety of skills beacuse ai can give them what they want and not what they need, this feels like a limit in the tech community . I think if you want to make it in a market like this you join entry level and rise through the ranks.

I think the tiktok ban is very stupid and it would probably hurt our Economics system even when its already trash. they couldve instead addressed the tiktok CEO privately and asked questions that actually mattered instead of asking if tiktok can read minds, they could put restrictions or done something else. I would implement a a feature where you could leave notes on the presdidents associates and himselfs posts without any filters and there would be no #democrat or #republican. Social media isn;'t stupid its only stupid when put into the wrong hands .
