My bolt light sensor chose to opererate when my light shined in a specific spot of the sphearo ball, Well... not just one spot but certain spots on the ball. it succesfully measured light, but i thought it was malfunctioning cause it wasn't reacting some times but i soon found out that it was due to the amount of light around it like the lamps and other peoples flash lights and because i had set it to the right light setting just to have to change it because that setting wasn't right ethier.

Computer science impacts my life in weird ways, liidn't do anything wrong, Although i am not use too formats like this so it gets kind of hard and confusing for me .
# September 17, 2024ke everytime i see  robot i always wonder what type of coding they used to command it or how they program games like subway surfers.

Today we are working on how computer science can influence other careers that are related to computer science, My first example is Police officers cameras, like in the video police wear cameras so they can enhance the saftey of officers and civilians. my second Example is Facial recongnition technology, Facial recongnition tech uses Clearview AI for police and or to identify Suspects, victims.

Some ways AI can help us is by running facial scans someimes people mistake other people for others like twins but most twins have one slight detail to tell one from another , and some ways AI cant hurt is that AI doesn't have feelings so when your grieving an AI therapy robot cant sympythize with you .

It is important for you to protect your private data because you could easily get hacked and the hackers could stela your money and other finances, they could also commit cyber crimes in your name. Some actions i could take to make sure that my socials are secure is by avoiding suspicious websites and cookies are on those very websites. Yes i have shared something very personal but i have taken the right actions and removed the content. How i could balance be on social media while keeping my privacy is not awnser Unusual questions or text back people who try and offer me strange scams .

What concerens me about this type of technology is that Some people can't tell whats real and whats not. A way it think this tech couod be used is in is cyber security. I think that a robot should see the world through our eyes and value life as much as we do .

the brain rot term to me means Content that fries your brain. Although social media is one of mans greatest inventions it has more bad then good impacts on alot of things other than my mind. recently The words lore connects to dad lore from the memes and i don't know where slop comes from.
In today's generration i don't think it's possible to multit-task.

I think that AI will affect the animation industry negatively, I think this affects people with a wide variety of skills beacuse ai can give them what they want and not what they need, this feels like a limit in the tech community . I think if you want to make it in a market like this you join entry level and rise through the ranks.

I think the tiktok ban is very stupid and it would probably hurt our Economics system even when its already trash. they couldve instead addressed the tiktok CEO privately and asked questions that actually mattered instead of asking if tiktok can read minds, they could put restrictions or done something else. I would implement a a feature where you could leave notes on the presdidents associates and himselfs posts without any filters and there would be no #democrat or #republican. Social media isn't stupid its only stupid when put into the wrong hands .

I honestly think cyber Security aviation could have had a hand in this since trump fired the guy that checks the integrity of if planes are safe to bored or not. Cybersecurity breaches can compromise the safety and consistency of flight operations, damage the reputation of airlines, and result in financial loss, impacting both airlines and passengers. With standardized cybersecurity processes and reduced vulnerabilities, passengers may be less likely to be affected by cyber-related incidents. The primary role of aviation cybersecurity is to secure aircraft and associated systems against potential cyberattacks. This includes ensuring the safety and integrity of communication, navigation and operational systems on board the aircraft. those reasons are very important to cyber security aviation feild, securing jobs like those makes you a super hero .

I learned that death is a hard consept for us all when we are younger as we grow older we accept and expect it .

It could help surf the web and eventually picking up on the latest trends like dances, art, songs, and games. some benifits from undestanding todays kids slang is undestanding the mentality some kids have in humnor and also understanding scenerios where somethings that are tragic can be turned into funny jokes to cope instead of adults always thinking we are the most disrespectful generation of all time. i think that schools should leave slang alonbe because slang is a way that kids can express themselves while saying things adults dont understand. some misunderstanding like if i said " fire " and someone actually thought there was a fire or someone mightve thought i was probably gang affiliated .

I mostly used my phone over break, the app i mostly played was block blast and roblox. my entertainment being my phone and my tv were still boring somehow probably challenging my laziness to get off my butt. i learned that blue light keeps people addicted to their tv and phone screens.

I feel like this would have a small fight between the generations. old heads with complain that this technology will seperate families from watching things together. I believe the networks would have a feild day streaming this on netflix and hulu or on max or something. I know instagram will be gassing this up like the jake paul vs mike tyson fight.

Right now im trying to pass my classes but at the same time i wanna take care of myself but overall im doing alright. the most stressful thing about school is that teachers don't care about wether you pass of fail they wanna get through the day but that leads to laziness and then failing to put grades in and also failing to understand where a students coming from in a place of very high standards but can only get decent grades from all the stress and the thought about college and the army. things i do when im stressed is to just lay down play some rainfall noises on my tv and take a nap, or i just ask for help. my goal is to just make it to another year, but motiviation is harder to achieve . i trust my friend saith because even though ive only known her for a year shes shown me her true colors and their beautiful, she has also comforted me in my time of need so i trust her completely. thanks for listening .

With AI surfing the web and knowing the awnsers i believe the ai tools can come up with the awnsers and some scenario's for the reader to solve. the most useful feature would be that the anwser but you would have to search the web to get a different awnser so as to not have the same awnser as someone else. yes i would most definitely use it. as my grades are so low .
With my grades be very low i have using ai tools to help me study and try to pass these tests and quizzes especially in algebra. Using these ai tools could help me bump my grade up a bitm and also help me uderstand the unti and class better.

I do think 100 men could win because even if your a strong animal you can get tired when fighting off alot of entities. I think its so innapropriate that someone would make a suggestion like that because people are stupid and would do anything for clout and fame, there was a story on the internet about how a man intentionally jumped into a lion enclosure and gets mauled to death. this shows me that the internet acts like hive mind with thwo different personalities, one side likes this and the other likes that, it also shows that we would do anything just to argue .
